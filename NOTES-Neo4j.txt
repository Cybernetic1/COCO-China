Install and Start Neo4j
=======================

Download Neo4j Desktop version AppImage from Neo4j website.
	chmod a+x neo4j-desktop-1.5.0-x86_64.AppImage
Execute the AppImage.  Wait for it to initialize.

Add a new DBMS instance.  Use default the name, set a password.
Then click button to 'Start' the DBMS.  Wait for it to start.

On left menu, go to "Graph Apps" then fire up "Neo4j Browser".
If all goes well you'd see notice saying you're connected as user 'neo4j'
	with connection: bolt://localhost:7687

 (Alternatively, Neo4j Browser can be opened in local browser via this URL:
	http://localhost:7474/browser/
 Then within the browser, log into
	neo4j://localhost:7687
 using the new password you entered for the DBMS. )

 (From older versions, there is a first-time password: neo4j / neo4j.
 Seems no longer needed. )

Now you're ready to use the Neo4j graph DB server.

Useful Cyphers
==============

Delete all nodes and relationships:
	MATCH (n:Type) DETACH DELETE n

Delete all relationships:
	match ()-[r]->() delete r;

Return all relationships:
	Match (n)-[r]->(m) Return n,r,m

Return all nodes and relationships, including singleton nodes:
	MATCH (n) OPTIONAL MATCH (n)-[r]-() RETURN n, r;

Create relationship:
	MATCH (a:Char), (b:Char) WHERE ID(a) - ID(b) = 1
	CREATE (a)-[r:Smaller]->(b)

Set properties:
	MATCH (n:Node) WHERE ID(n)=$id
	SET n.name = $NewName

Create new node with relationship to old node:
	MATCH (old:Node {id:'1'})
	CREATE (old) -[:RELATED_TO]-> (new:Node {id:'2'})

Create our "Tasks" graph with Python
====================================

The Python script 'build-tasks-graph.py' creates a simple graph for our project.
In order to use Python to access Neo4j, you need to install
	pip3 install neo4j
You may run this after Neo4j server is running:
	python build-tasks-graph.py
In Neo4j Browser, left menu "Database Information",
	click on "node" to see a sample of the created graph.

Try NeoVis visualization
========================

Assume you have a non-empty graph DB running in Neo4j server.
Open in the browser, eg:
	chromium-browser technical-white-paper.html
Go to the last part of the web page.  You should see a NeoVis demo.
